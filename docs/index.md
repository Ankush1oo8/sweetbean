# SweetBean

SweetBean is an
open-source [domain-specific programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) in Python
built for the declarative specification of stimuli sequences and the synthesis of JavaScript or HTML-files ready to be
served as online experiments to the web.

The same experiments can be run used Large Language Models or Vision Models as synthetic participants.

## Motivation

Crowd-sourced online experiments have become increasingly popular across the behavioral sciences, including cognitive
psychology, social psychology, and behavioral economics. The success of online experiments can be partly attributed to
the ability to collect larger data sets within shorter periods compared to lab-based experiments. On a practical level,
online experiments have been facilitated by the development of open-source software for building online experiments,
such as [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/).

However, the development of online experiments can be time-consuming and error-prone. SweetBean aims to simplify the
process of creating online experiments by providing a domain-specific language for specifying the structure of an
experiment. SweetBean is designed to be easy to use, even for researchers with little programming experience.

Additionally, SweetBean experiment can be run with synthetic participants, such as Large Language Models or
Vision Models, to generate data for pilot studies or to test and fine-tune AI models to generate human-like data.
